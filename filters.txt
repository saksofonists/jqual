This file is parsed line-by-line and all lines that do not match a very specific format
are ignored. a.k.a. Everything is a comment unless it matches the format below.
"/Regex/That/Matches/A/Path/In/Json" = type
Where the regex is just a regex, nothing fancy, and the type is one of:
- ignore,
- presence,
- type,
- trim

Here are some examples:
Any differences in SubItem2 or it's existence will be ignored
"/Item/SubItem2" = ignore

We only check if the item is there, nothing else
"/Item/SubItem/Key3" = presence

We check if the item is there and it's the same type between files, but we ignore the value
"/Item/SubItem/Key2" = type

Here are some example regexes:

Ignore Item and anything inside it
"/Item.*" = ignore

Ignore the value of "Field" in all items inside "List"
"/List\[.*\]/Field" = presence

Ignore everything. Why would you?
"/" = ignore
