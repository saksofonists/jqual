# jqual
Simple tool to simply compare two json files. Some configuration is possible to exclude fields/values

Pass the file names as command line arguments. Not much flexibility here.
./jqual filters.txt input1.json input2.json

To modify the behaviour of the tool, use the filters file. You can [check the example](./filters.txt) file for more information.
